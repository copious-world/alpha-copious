# Copious Backbone

## Applicant 

* Richard Leddy

* 707-291-3296 (*if calling, please consider texting first and calling from public area code numbers*)

## Description

As a part of copious.world, a set of cooperating backend processes have been developed for a few purposes: 1) sequence client authrozed sessions by tracking tokens; 2) move encrypted data using meta object descriptors assigned to DID identities; 3) use meta object descriptors to provide data awareness to generic search facilities; 4) use meta object descriptors to facilitate delivery and decription of data.

The repositories provide a basis for developing a hybrid cloud with some P2P components. Developers should be able to rapidly derive applications from generalized classes.

## Reason for Applying

Currenty I have node supporting resources nor sponsorship. I don't know what I can really expect of the foundation at this point.

## Statement of alignment with OpenJS Foundation charter and mission

Please refer to [the Cross Project Council's Charter](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/CPC-CHARTER.md).
Please keep your answer to less than 250 words. (counting my response words 150+/- words)

* promote the widespread adoption and continued development of key JavaScript and web solutions and related technologies.

> This project provides fully extensible node.js classes, a number of which run vanilla (default) services when installed globably. The developer can begin extending and testing in a short time.
 
* facilitate collaboration within the JavaScript development community.

> This project may spawn some standarization. For example, after working with IPFS and Bittorrent, the meta descriptors of media reveal themselves to be very like torrent files, yet the meta descriptors contain field for selecting the P2P storage system to be accessed via a repository bridge.

* create a center of gravity for open source projects throughout the end-to-end JavaScript ecosystem guiding them toward open governance and diverse collaborator bases.

> The project code attemtps to set a basic formal (code based) model in which a number of projects can be instantiated.

* host the infrastructure to support hosted JavaScript open source projects.

> This project recognizes the mission of the foundation and would welcome hosting. Of course, this project addresses storage processes.

* enable, through advancement of Projects and strategic partnerships, an open and accessible web.

> The repositories of this project provide a foundation for privacy based access and secure ownership of media and code assets. It hopes to make the web (and the world) a safer place to create and share information.

## Impact and users of the project

- What is the ecosystem impact of the project? 

When we speak of full stack, we often set a conceptual boundary with a single web application server with a specific DB running locally. But, we can break apart the application server into services that share information.

- Who are the biggest users of the project? (_if they are not JavaScript space, then will it ever expand to JavaScript space_)

Currently, myself and some regular downloaders.

My current use is for the generation of a collection of websites that capture contracted ownership of media on the behalf of creators for their ownership, that provide media owners contracted uploading and publication services, and provides the execution of contracts for streaming customers on behalf of uploaders.

- What is the potential long term impact and adoption?

JavaScript developers should have the ability to create global secure session and token sharing among custom peers. 

- How does it differ from other projects?

This project expands beyond the conceptual boundary, expanding the stack. The DB may still be there. But, some pathways exist to allow media publication management to services that might use DBs. The DB link might not exists within the most front facing server.

Logging in will not require a centralized storage of human information, but business will be conducted with identities. There is a structure for sharing session and tokens between services.

Some data transfer may be rapid enough for MQTT and similar services within the context of session and token sharing.

A use of this project seeks to identify ownership of composited assets (media) and to provide composite contracts for use.


## Desired Initial Project Phase

Please refer to [Section III, Stages - Definitions & Expectations](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/PROJECT_PROGRESSION.md#iii-stages---definitions--expectations) of PROJECT_PROGRESSION.md.

## Social Media Accounts

## Official Communication Channels

rleddy@copious.world

## Security Policy

To be done. Currently, communications are expected to use elliptic key derivation and web pages link via TLS to nginx on Linux. Encrypted assest are being eniphered with AES.

## Governance Structure

* Is there a leadership team?
* Who are the members of the leadership team?
* How are members of the leadership team nominated?
* How are individuals outside of leadership given commit access?

This is still one person hoping to develop a team. I am aware of Raddicle. 

* Is the project open/willing to move to open governance, if not already in place?

Yes. 

* Is the project willing to adopt the OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct (CoC)?

Yes.

* Please share links to all existing documentation e.g. GOVERNANCE.md / CONTRIBUTING.md

To be done.

## Existing Financial Sponsorship

This project is receiving no funds at this time.

## Infrastructure Needs or Requests


All of my machines are getting old. I am running stuff on very small machines (to prove a point). But, there may need to be a change.

## Questions?

Does the foundation help with sponsorship?
Does giving up IP give up rights to direction or use?
