# Application

Project: **Repository Bridge :: Add an IPFS Renterd for Sia**

For the Sia Foundation.

## Copious Systems 

* Copious Systems is a ficticious business name recognized as an account with Wells Fargo. Currently, this is an individual propietorship.

* copious.world is a website owned by Richard A. Leddy

* [copious-world](https://github.com/orgs/copious-world/repositories?language=&page=2&q=&sort=&type=all) is a collection of git repositories on GitHub.


## Repository Bridge :: Renterd with IFPS for Sia

### Purpose:

The aim of this project will be to use **renterd** as a backend for an IPFS gateway. The copious-world project may be used as a test case by making this storage backend accessible to the copious-world **Repository Bridge**.

The **Repository Bridge** is a part of a larger project, copious-world, that provides processes and interfaces aimed at helping people claim ownership of their digital assets from the moment of inception and onward. The **Repository Bridge** provides an interface to P2P distributed storage repositories such as IPFS, Bitorrent, and others.

Currently, the **Repository Bridge** is a module (npm package from node.js) that can be used inside a larger program that uses files and associates pairs of identififiers with the files. Here, the pairs are comprised of an application identifier, a hash, and a repository identifier, another hash. For example, in the copious-world project, the copious-world hashes are UCWIDs and they are paired with IPFS hashes, provided the IPFS type of repository is specified in the file metadescriptors.

The **Repository Bridge** does not establish any financial relationship with storage concerns. But, it might act as client to Renterd.


### Open Source:

Most of the [copious-world](https://github.com/orgs/copious-world/repositories?language=&page=2&q=&sort=&type=all) repositories are open source.

The languages utilized in this project so far are JavaScript and C++. The project is expanding with Rust in some cases. Other languages may be put to use.

### Timeline

**6 Months**

1. Develop architecture and unit code; set up required hardware
2. Continue unit code plus external control code, e.g. command line and web
3. Address business processes with new code 
4. End to end testing
5. Integration into targeted use cases
6. Test and documentation

### Risks

This project should address the feature expectations already salient in the Sia community.

A few new computers will be needed to make sure that current development tools can be installed and operate at best performance.

The budget must ensure the Internet connections, electricity, office expenses. 

The budget must ensure at least one developer.

After programming many years for a number of projects and always delivering, I have spent time with IPFS and used it in my project.

### Budget

**\$60,000.00**

This is \$10,000.00 per month. This covers in part, the salary of a senior developer and tools.

Tools may include computers. Computers may be \$700.00 to \$3000.00 such as a relatively new laptop, one server with up to 4 Terabytes storage.
